I'm Muhammad 

I was a PhD student at the University of Twente for less than 2 years. Now, I work as a data analyst/scientist at Exact in the Netherlands.

My website is built using the [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package. Before that I used Hugo and the blogdown package for my website.
